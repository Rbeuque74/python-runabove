Openstack
=========

This is a realy basic Python script showing how to instanciate a fully
functional instance of novaclient, swiftclient and neutronclient using
a Runabove provided Openstack token.

This script may easily be adapted to instanciate any other OpenStack
client.

To launch the script install RunAbove SDK and just enter:
```bash
pip install python-novaclient python-swiftclient python-neutronclient
python openstack.py
```
